  <div class="common intro">Zain Javadd "Zayn" Malik (born January 12, 1993), also known mononymously as Zayn, is a former member of British-Irish band One Direction.

    He left the band on March 25, 2015. Zayn left to pursue a solo music career. His debut solo album, Mind of Mine, was released on March 25, 2016. His second album, Icarus Falls, was released on December 14, 2018. And released his third album, "Nobody is listening" on 15th January 2021.</div>
  <div class="common bio">
    Zayn was born in West Lane, Baildon, Bradford, England. He is of English and Pakistani descent. He was born to British-Pakistani father Yaser Malik and English mother Patricia. He has one older sister, Doniya, and two younger sisters, Waliyha and Safaa. He and his family are Muslim. Zayn grew up in East Bowling, located south of the Bradford city centre. He was a student at Lower Fields Primary School in East Bowling and went to Tong High School, a state comprehensive school.

Zayn's mother, Trisha, told the BBC in 2013 about her son's religious upbringing, stating “I made sure the children went to the mosque. Zayn has read the Quran three times.” When Zayn was growing up, Trisha worked as a halal chef at a primary school, cooking meals for Muslim children

  <div class="common life">
    Zayn sang "Let Me Love You", a 2004 hit by R&B singer Mario. All three judges — Simon, Louis, and Nicole — gave him a 'yes'. His audition was initially not broadcast, but was later shown briefly on The Xtra Factor.

    Zayn was noted for becoming nervous and withdrawn in boot camp, and famously refused to participate in a dance segment until personally encouraged by Simon Cowell. He passed the dance stage but failed to proceed past boot camp, where he was initially eliminated as a solo artist, but brought back to be added to the group that would become One Direction. Following their placing third on The X Factor, One Direction signed a record contract with Sony Music subsidiary Syco Music, releasing 4 #1 albums with Zayn (and 1 without), and completing 4 world tours in 4 years.

Pillowtalk debuted at #1 on iTunes in 90 countries, making Zayn only one of two male artists to debut at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2016. Zayn's debut album, Mind of Mine, was released March 25, 2016 - a year to the day he left One Direction. He became the first UK male artist to debut at #1 in the US and UK. Zayn subsequently released music videos for album tracks 'It's You' and 'BeFour' and released 'Like I Would' as the second official single, which he performed at the 2016 IHeartRadio awards.

  <div class="common fam">
    Zayn's parents are Yaser and Trisha Malik. He has three sisters; Safaa, Duniya and Waliyha. Zayn credits his father's music taste as a primary influence on his singing and songwriting. In One Direction's 2013 film This Is Us, Zayn is shown buying a house for his entire family, stating this was the reason he wanted to be a successful entertainer, so he could give back to, and provide for, his family. His father was not featured in the film. Zayn has a daughter with Gigi Hadid, Khai Hadid Malik.
